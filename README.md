Each week, the drilling contractors send out projections of the active drill holes to the geology department to track the drill holes progress and spatial accuracy (to target and plan). This compliance to plan (C2D) report is generated from the geology department as a formal document to inform the drilling contractors, operations department and any other stakeholders on the progress and drill tracking compliance of each rig/drill hole.
